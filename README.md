A simple test of capturing frames from a webcam using OpenCV in C++.

This test depends on OpenCV 4.8.0 which can be downloaded at [https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/download/4.8.0/opencv-4.8.0-windows.exe](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/download/4.8.0/opencv-4.8.0-windows.exe). It must be extract to ./opencv/ unless you change all the references in the project settings.

The following screenshots show the project settings that refer to OpenCV:
